## Unnamed Token Project

This is the alpha version of a new Token/NFT Ecosystem. Users will be able to buy an NFT which will have different *levels*. To buy the NFT a user must hold *x* amount of the ecosystems token as well as pay the predetermined amount.  Users will then be able to Stake the token as long as they own one of the levels of NFT available.  Without owning the NFT and holding it in your wallet users will not be able to stake/unstake/claim rewards.  Staking rewards will be financed by an original allocation of the token in a to be decided amount.  After this staking rewards will be financed by a transaction fee economy.  To transfer both the Token or NFT users must pay a to be decided fee in the token. These fees will be sent to a vault contract where they can then be redistributed.  Ideally this will be controlled by a DAO but it is unrealistic to think a DAO can be stood up without substantial user base capture.

**The staking allocation along with a Initial Liquidity allocation will be the only allocations!**

There will be no Developer or Team allocation.  There will be no VC Allocation. The only allocations at the token deployment will be the staking allocation and an inital liquidity allocation..  The developers want this project to be a community/social experiment.  In a world where every token that is released has huge allocations to teams, investors, insiders and the like we want to release a project that is for the community by the community.

### Project Liquidity

As mentioned to purchase an NFT the user must hold *x* amount of the token AND Pay a to be determined amount.  100% of the funds aquired from the NFT Sale will go towards an initial liquidity pool. The Dex/Chain that will be utilized is still to be decided and should be chosen by the community.  Once the Liquidity pool is stood up it will be up to the community to fund liquidty further.  

### Transaction Fees

The fees required to transfer the NFTs as well as tokens will not be exorbitant and will be a configurable but static amount.  Each transaction will have a flat fee.  it will cost the same to transfer 1 token as it would be to transfer 100000.  This will make slippage requirements and transaction costs predicatble. 

### DAO

Ideally all decesions ill eventually be made my a DAO.  At project inception this is obviously not possible due to a lacking user base.  if the user base should increase to a reasonable amount a DAO will be instituted. 

### Tokenomics

This is a WIP and tokenomics are to be determined.
